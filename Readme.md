# MeshAI

MeshAI is a decentralized artificial intelligence system that allows machine learning models to be trained and shared across a network of nodes. MeshAI is built using the Go programming language for the node software, the Gorgonia library for the machine learning backend, and the Ethereum blockchain for the decentralized network.

## Getting Started

To get started with MeshAI, you'll need to install the following software:

- Go
- Gorgonia
- Vyper
- Ethereum client (e.g., Geth, Parity)

Once you have these dependencies installed, you can clone the MeshAI repository and start building your own decentralized AI system.

## Architecture

MeshAI is designed to be a modular system that can be customized and extended to fit your specific use case. The core components of the MeshAI architecture include:

- Node Language: Go
- AI Backend: Gorgonia
- Ethereum Contracts: Vyper

## Usage

To use MeshAI, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new machine learning model using Gorgonia.
2. Deploy the MeshAI smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain using Vyper.
3. Register the machine learning model with the MeshAI smart contract.
4. Train the machine learning model using Gorgonia and save it to disk.
5. Share the trained machine learning model with other nodes on the MeshAI network.
