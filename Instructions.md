# MeshAI Instructions

MeshAI is a decentralized artificial intelligence system built on top of Ethereum blockchain. It enables machine learning models to be trained and shared across a network of nodes, allowing for more efficient and secure data processing. MeshAI uses Go as its node language and Gorgonia as its AI backend, and employs smart contracts written in Vyper to manage the network of nodes.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use MeshAI, you'll need to install the following software:

- Go
- Gorgonia
- Vyper
- Ethereum client (e.g., Geth, Parity)

## Installation

To install MeshAI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the MeshAI repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/TheCompAce/MeshAI.git

2. Navigate to the `meshai` directory:
    cd meshai

3. Install the Go dependencies:
    go get -v ./...

4. Install the Vyper dependencies:
    pip install vyper

5. Compile the Vyper contracts:
    vyper meshai.vy

6. Deploy the Vyper contracts to the Ethereum blockchain:
    vyper deploy meshai.vy --blockchain ethereum

7. Run the MeshAI node:
    go run main.go
This will start the MeshAI node on your local machine.

## Usage

To use MeshAI, follow these steps:

1. Create a new machine learning model using Gorgonia.
2. Register the machine learning model with the MeshAI smart contract.
3. Train the machine learning model using Gorgonia and save it to disk.
4. Share the trained machine learning model with other nodes on the MeshAI network.
For more detailed instructions on using MeshAI, please see the README.md file in the MeshAI repository.
